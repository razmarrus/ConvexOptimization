# ConvexOptimization

This is a pack of six practicals university task in subject called

Here you only five tasks can be found in form of distinct files as the first task was dedicated to optimising of inverting matrices and was about 20 lines long. Nevertheles, it can be found in task number two in form of a function.

**List of tasks:**
1. optimization of matrices inverting
2. step of simplex method
3. simplex method itself
4. dual simplex method
5. matrix transport problem (potential method)
6. quadratic programming
